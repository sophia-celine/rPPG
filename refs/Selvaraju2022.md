# Continuous Monitoring of Vital Signs Using Cameras: A Systematic Review

Selvaraju, V.; Spicher, N.; Wang, J.; Ganapathy, N.; Warnecke, J.M.; Leonhardt, S.; Swaminathan, R.; Deserno, T.M. Continuous Monitoring of Vital Signs Using Cameras: A Systematic Review. Sensors 2022, 22, 4097. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22114097

HR and RR can be measured using red, green, and blue (RGB) and near-infrared
(NIR) as well as far-infrared (FIR) cameras. So far, BP and SpO2 are monitored with RGB cameras
only, whereas BST is derived from FIR cameras only

> Several parameters affect the image quality of cameras, such as spectrum range, sensor
hardware, frame rate, frame resolution, or camera–subject distance. Frame rate ranges
from 1 frame per second (fps) to 500 fps. For fast moving subjects, frame rates of 100 fps to
500 fps were employed [45,49,118,119], however 10–30 fps was used often.
